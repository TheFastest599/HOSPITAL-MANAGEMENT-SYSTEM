# Health Wings Hospital Management System (Class 12 Project)

Health Wings Hospital Management System is a GUI-based application developed in Python using TkInter for the interface, Pandas for data manipulation, and CSV for data storage. The system is designed to streamline the process of bed booking and patient record management in a hospital setting.

## Features

The system provides two distinct interfaces:

1. **Patient Interface**: This interface allows patients to check the availability of beds in real-time, book a suitable bed, and retrieve their previous visit details using a unique ID.

2. **Staff Interface**: This interface is designed for hospital staff. It provides information on bed availability and patient details. Staff can change the status of the beds, book a bed for a patient, retrieve previous patient details, and print these details in PDF format.
