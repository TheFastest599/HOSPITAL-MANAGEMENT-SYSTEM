HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM



With the help of this code, especially in these COVID times, 
patients can easily pre-book appointments or rooms as necessary. 
Therefore, eliminating the need to visit a hospital physically for an 
appointment and also the time spent in describing and analysing 
the patientâ€™s needs upon arrival in a hospital.
Any external person will be able to view the no. of beds 
vacant(even in COVID ward) in the hospital, hence they can take 
decisions of which hospital they should go to without visiting each 
separately.
